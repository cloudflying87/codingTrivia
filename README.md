# codingTrivia
Develop a trivia game, with a timer, and scoring. 
This game was a practice in manipulating the DOM with JS. This was a good exercise to learn working with Objects, arrays and putting them on and off the page. 

I created the formatting with bootstrap to create a basic grid layout and used bootstrap button styling. I also used this to make my game stay in the center of the screen. I also added the coloring of the buttons when the answer is correct or incorrect. I have that displaying for the user with a .5 second delay. 

Further development of this quiz would include finishing the highscore function of the quiz. I currently am able to write it to the local storage, but reading it back from the local storage and adding data to it is giving me issues. I also was able to clear the screen in preparation for displaying the data for the high score but could not get the high score to display. I think that I have all of the code there, it is just throwing an error that I am unable to solve in the time I have. 

I also have decided to allow the user to get a negative score with too many incorrect answers. This could be something that could be further refined with more development. I also noticed some strange behavior as I click the high scores link and back to the game.
